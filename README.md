# Portfolio-2.0
The purpose of this repository is to offer guidance and insight into my minimalistic and clean portfolio website, which showcases my academic interests, skills, and experiences as a CS Undegrad. The website has a minimal, clean, user-friendly interface designed to provide a seamless browsing experience for visitors.

## Technical Details

The website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS
- Hosting solution - GitHub Pages and Netlify
- Optional

## Contributing

While I appreciate any interest in contributing to the website, it's primarily a personal project, and I would like to maintain control over its development. However, if you've spotted an issue or have feedback, please feel free to open an issue on this repository, and I'll consider your suggestions.
